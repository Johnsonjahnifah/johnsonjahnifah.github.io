## Favorite CPSC120L Labs

* Lab 2 part one
I enjoyed lab two because we got to experiment with strings to create variables and those variables initialized to their commands.I learned how to use strings for the process of user input and output.Overall this lab was nice.

* Lab 6 part two
This was the most fun lab because I got to see inside the thought process for games like blackjack. I learned how scoring translates to code to merge into a fair game. It showed me the importance of code being correct with no bugs to maintain fairness and peace in a game like black jack which is a gambling game.


* Lab 9 part one
I enjoyed lab 9 because I learned how to play with vectors in c++.In this lab I was taught the importance of file names.This lab helped further my skills with loops, file processing and vectors
